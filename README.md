# AVL-Trees-Project




This project involves implementing search, insert, and remove operations for both normal binary trees and AVL trees, along with functionalities to find the maximum and minimum values in the trees. Additionally, the project includes different tree traversal algorithms such as inorder, preorder, level order, and postorder traversal. The system also features functions for rebalancing the AVL tree as needed. A final function is designed for stock analysis, where an AVL tree containing index fund data is utilized to find the best return for investors by removing poorly performing penny stocks. The function filters stocks with a price-to-earnings ratio below a specified threshold, providing investors with optimized investment options based on the given criteria.
